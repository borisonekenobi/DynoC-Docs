  <h1>Contributing</h1>
  <p>
    The DynoC compiler is currently a closed-source project.
    For now, contributions are limited to providing feedback, reporting bugs,
    and suggesting new features through the
    <a href="https://github.com/borisonekenobi/DynoC-Docs/issues" target="_blank">GitHub Issues</a> page.
  </p>

  <p>
    If and when the compiler becomes open source, anyone will be able to
    fork the repository, make improvements, and submit a pull request for review.
    Until then, your input through issues and discussions is highly appreciated and
    will help shape the future of the language.
  </p>

  <div class="note info">
    <p><strong>Note:</strong> If you encounter a bug, please include steps to reproduce,
      expected behavior, and your environment details (OS, version, etc.).
      This will make it easier to address issues quickly.</p>
